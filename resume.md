## <small>From the desk of</small> [Larry Marburger](mailto:larry@marburger.cc) {: #resume }

I built [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com) and I'm passionate about my craft.
I care about building products focused around people and how they interact
with them. Test-driven design and iterative development have changed the way I
approach problems. I take strides every day to improve myself and skills by
being active in [my local Ruby users' group][ruby_group], attending mind
expanding events like [Ruby DCamp][ruby_dcamp] and exploring new technologies.


### Experience

#### Open Source {: #oss }

I use and contribute to Open Source Software.

 - Much of the [code we write at CloudApp][cloudapp-oss] is open source
   including [the app that serves all cl.ly links][viso] and a
   [CLI and API wrapper for Ruby][cloudapp.rb].
 - [bundler-api][]: I help the Bundler team by volunteering to keep the API up
   and running as well as adding metrics instrumentation to monitor
   performance in production. As a service to the community,
   [the dashboard][dashboard] is publicly accessible.
 - [metriks-middleware][]: A rack middleware to collect simple metrics.
 - [p2met][]: [Eric Lindvall][eric] and I collaborated on a project to get
   logged metrics data from [Papertrail][] into
   [Librato Metrics][librato-metrics].
 - [pilfer][]: Line profiling for your production applications.

#### Homeopathic Code Remedyologist, CloudApp <small>2010-Present</small>  {: #cloudapp }

I found Max and Nick early in 2010 and immediately fell in love with CloudApp.
With TDD and a vast array of open source at my disposal, namely Ruby and Rails,
I joined the team and turned their proof of concept into a solid product. When
it grew into a monolith, I refactored it into several smaller, agile
applications each with clear concerns.


#### Freelance Web Developer <small>2009-2010</small>
I craved working _with_ clients to build something awesome instead of being
handed a signed legal document stating the exact features that must be present
in a project. In order to realize this dream, I knew I needed to find my own
clients and cultivate that relationship instead of relying on my employer to do
it for me. This is what led me to Max, Nick, and [CloudApp][cloudapp].

#### Web Developer, andCulture <small>Harrisburg, PA 2007-2009</small>
I came on board because of my skills with JavaScript and experience with C# and
ASP.NET. andCulture gave me the freedom to discover and deliver my first Rails
site. We were too dependent on Microsoft technologies to make the switch for all
future projects and I wasn't self-loathing enough to go back after drinking of
the sweet nectar that is Ruby.

#### Web Developer, Elexio <small>Elizabethtown, PA 2002-2007</small>  {: #elexio }
Hired as a salesman for an in-house developed CMS written in ASP 3.0, I fell
into the role of the sole customer support representative in lieu of being fired
after my paperweight and I tied in number of sales. I single-handedly helped
people use one of the worst products on the market both directly and by writing
a vast library of knowledge base articles. I slowly made the transition to full
time developer after mastering Regular Expressions to build a wildly successful
web crawler to pluck email addresses from church directories. I helped build a
less awful version of their CMS using C# and ASP.NET 1.1 and discovered my true
love of coding by writing JavaScript to construct a cross-browser WYSIWYG
content editor. Thankfully Firefox and Safari added support for
[contentEditable] and obviated the need.


### Education

#### DeVry College of Technology <small>North Brunswick, NJ</small>
4 out of 5 trimesters of an Associates of Telecommunications Management Degree
completed before dropping out to accept the
[aforementioned sales position][elexio] in 2002.
