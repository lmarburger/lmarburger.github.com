## <small>From the desk of</small> [Larry Marburger](mailto:larry@marburger.cc) {: #resume }

I build websites and I'm passionate about my craft. I care about building sites
focused around people and how they will interact with them. I'm a firm believer
in using test-driven and iterative development practices. I take strides every
day to improve myself and skills by being active in
[my local Ruby users' group][ruby_group] and exploring new technologies.


### Experience

#### Homeopathic Code Remedyologist <small>Middletown, PA 2009-Present</small>
I craved working _with_ clients to build something awesome instead of being
handed a signed legal document stating the exact features that must be present
in a project. In order to realize this dream, I knew I needed to find my own
clients and cultivate that relationship instead of relying on my employer to do
it for me. I've been coding Rails freelance ever since and loving it.

#### Web Developer, andCulture <small>Harrisburg, PA 2007-2009</small>
I came on board because of my skills with JavaScript and experience with C# and
ASP.NET. andCulture gave me the freedom to discover and deliver my first Rails
site. We were too dependent on Microsoft technologies to make the switch for all
future projects and I wasn't self-loathing enough to go back after drinking of
the sweet nectar that is Ruby.

#### Web Developer, Elexio <small>Elizabethtown, PA 2002-2007</small>  {: #elexio }
Hired as a salesman for an in-house developed CMS written in ASP, I fell into
the role of the sole customer support representative in lieu of being fired
after I failed to make a single sale. After about two years helping customers
use one of the worst products on the market, I slowly made the transition to
full time developer after I mastered Regular Expressions and built a wildly
successful web crawler to pluck email addresses from church directories. I
helped build a less awful version of their CMS using C# and ASP.NET 1.1 and did
a lot of JavaScript work trying to build a cross-browser WYSIWYG content editor
that I was never able to complete.


### Education

#### DeVry College of Technology <small>North Brunswick, NJ</small>
4 out of 5 trimesters of an Associates of Telecommunications Management Degree
completed before dropping out to accept the
[aforementioned sales position][elexio] in 2002.


### Referrals

#### [Joshua Miller][josh]
After meeting at [a Ruby meetup][ruby_group], we've worked a lot together since
I started my freelance career.

#### [Francis Lukesh][fran]
My direct supervisor at andCulture for about half the time I was employed and a
terrific friend.

#### [Rogie King][rogie]
We haven't had the pleasure to work together on a project, but I mock his
designs and he tells me I can't code my way out of a paper bag.

#### Annette Light
My mother. Who would know my faults better than the person responsible for me
and who I drove insane while navigating my awkward teenage years?
