title: Why Content Management Systems Bother Me

A large percentage of my time as a "professional" developer has been spent building a content management system. I've been away from that product for 2 years and coming back to face the thought of building yet another CMS caused me to reflect.

We spend a great deal of time focusing and refining the experience average users have with our websites and at the end of that process we slap it on top of a generic CMS our clients interact with to manage that website. I believe we're missing a key ingredient in this equation.

I want to build a CMS that is not just customized for each client, but is individually crafted. Sure, every website has at its core the same basic needs, but that doesn't necessarily mean every website can be crowbarred into the same set of management tools. I want to build websites where every user's experience--both our clients and theirs--are kept at the forefront of what we create.
