title: What I Dislike About Content Management Systems

A large percentage of my time as a "professional" developer has been spent building a content management system. I've been away from that product for 2 years and coming back to face the thought of building or working with yet another CMS made me pause and mull over the past.

We as web developers and designers invest a great deal of time focusing and refining the experience average users have with our websites. We build and tweak and destroy and polish until it's flawless and then hand over our creation to a developer who slaps it on top of their generic CMS. Our clients interact with this software on a daily basis yet very little consideration is given to the experience they have with our system. That they can edit the content on their website at all should be good enough for them.

I'm convinced we're overlooking a great opportunity to excel.

I want to build a CMS that is not just customized for each client but is individually crafted. Sure, every website has some core functionality that's similar, but that doesn't necessarily imply every website can be crowbarred into the same set of management tools. I want to build websites where every user's experience--both our clients and theirs--are kept at the forefront of what we produce. I don't ever again want to feel like what I've built is just "good enough".

I have no interest it designing yet another content management system.
