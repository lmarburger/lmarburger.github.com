Not a visual refresh--although the design was rebuilt using [Sass][sass] and the [Blueprint CSS framework][blueprint] with the help of the **amazing** [Compass][compass] project ([Chris Eppstein][chriseppstein], you rock. Seriously.)--but more of a purpose refresh. It's apparent I'm not able to write long-winded blog posts with any level of consistency, but I have no trouble [tweeting 0.62 times daily][followcost]. I'll attempt to strike a balance somewhere between and hope for the best.

Part of the problem can be attributed to coding my own blog. It was my first deployed Rails project and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, but I soon realized I have no desire whatsoever in maintaining the code base. I've been keeping my eye on [Jekyll][jekyll] for a while and with the release of [GitHub Pages][githubpages] I think it's about time I make the switch. I'm still undecided how I feel about the dynamic content on the site having to be loaded ajaxily, but with any luck I'll manage to get over it.
